"Reading the book, the way Charlie behaves, communicates.<br>His fixation on asking about hockey and sports.<br>His blunt way of speaking<br>His fixations of reading and literature, diary keeping.<br>Pebbling by making and gifting people with personalised mixtapes.<br>His breakdowns, (in the book) uncontrollable crying or meltdowns.<br>Charlie is painfully relatable and to me autism coded/autistic.<br>Which would make his aunts SA even worse because she took advantage of a vulnerable person in two ways.

"Ok, hear me out, I have a reason of depression, I don‚Äôt want to sound bad or anything, but I feel like I‚Äôve lost and been through more than most can handle, at just the age of 8 months I was malnourished and neglected, at the age of 2-13 I was abused physically, mentally, and sexually (only once though) by both parents and their friends, at the age of 4 I was beat to the verge of breaking down totally, at the age of 6 I was raped, at 7 I lost my father to suicide one day after my birthday, when I was 8 my mother was addicted to drugs, at that point on I was abused and neglected, malnourished, starved, and was also abused by her girlfriend, I am quite unintelligent, this sounds stupid but also very unlucky and Unattractive, I was broken and still suffer from trauma to this day, I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think I long for this world, or contribute much, I will always be alone, I don‚Äôt understand why this happened, but there is nothing I can do about it",2,0.6590078473091125,love
"I kind of feel a similar way to how he feels. I just remembered a lot of repressed memories that I have from school and my last job. I wasn&#39;t actually sexually assaulted but I remember certain things like at my last job, the owners oldest son (older then my coworkers and I) basically spying and watching us on the cameras. It wasn&#39;t just to make sure that we were doing our jobs though. There were other things too like abuse in general. I&#39;ve had people threaten to kill me/beat me up, I&#39;ve been beat up before, people act creepy in certain ways towards me, etc. My family was more abusive in other ways like emotionally and verbally abusive. Watching this movie kind of helps me to deal with it all.<br><br>Edit: My mom has hit me before too. I was actually physically assaulted both at school and at work mostly though.",0,0.635502815246582,sadness
"I remember how he wrapped his arms around me to tell me it would all be okay, and that the pain will go away soon. But it never did. Ever since that day that he first did it, it feels like my insides are bleeding. I feel dirty no matter how many times i scrub at my skin in the shower. I can always feel his breathe against my right ear, I can‚Äôt bear to look at myself in the mirror anymore without seeing some vulnerable boy that could‚Äôve stopped it. Everyone tells me that it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I sure don‚Äôt believe that. I feel broken, forever broken. I can‚Äôt even handle people embracing me anymore. So what‚Äôs the point in living in this reality where he gets to live life to his fullest when I‚Äôm stuck here forever feeling like the little kid i once was, i remember telling my friend about what happened to me and all he did was laugh and say that you would never do that to me. You didn‚Äôt seem like the type of person to do those things, but you did. Nowadays I still flinch and despise taking pictures because of what you‚Äôve done to me. Each time the camera would flicker you‚Äôd strip more of my innocence away, and no matter how many times you apologize I won‚Äôt forget those 4 years that you ruined me. <br><br><br><br>                                         To my Older Cousin",2,0.8972740769386292,love
"This entire scene really resonates with me on a very deep level. The summer of last year was pretty shit. Honestly every time was really shit, but that summer had some definite highlights. I thankfully never suffered sexual abuse, but I have my fair share of emotional and familial trauma, as well as a slew of other problems that fucked with me for years. That shit just gets to you and overtakes your whole life. When Charlie was alone at home, walking through the house frantically, holding back his tears, and then finally looked at the knife, it‚Äôs exactly what it was like for me when I was close to harming myself with my own kitchen knife. I was just so stuck in my head for so long, and at that point I was overwhelmed with the cluster fuck of regrets, traumas, self hating, and my whole life just playing out with me wishing things were different. When you‚Äôre in that place it just seems like nothing ever went right, and that everything is your fault, and that everyone and everything would be better off without you. But in reality you‚Äôre probably just using that as an excuse to justify the selfish want of wanting to kill yourself because u hate everything about you. You do it for you. I ended up being sent to the ER after having admitted to how I constantly told myself to just kill myself already and the number of times I came close to acting upon it. The doctor that came into the room had such a similar voice to the one in this clip, and it was a very weird feeling having my dad find out about everything. I‚Äôm doing my damn best rn to be in a better place, but goddamn it‚Äôs hard.",2,0.8043369054794312,love

It truly is a horrible thing to be depressed to the point of suicide. You literally try to think of all the ways to kill yourself and what would be the least painful for you and others.
