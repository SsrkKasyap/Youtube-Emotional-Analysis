"The ultimate film noir, with the wonderful Barbara Stanwyck playing the femme fatale, and not forgetting the Fred MacMurray, cast as the smooth insurance salesman who gets drawn into the web of deceit and murder. However, Edward G Robinson ‚Äòsteals‚Äô the film with his mesmerising and energetic performance as Barton Keyes, the claims manager. The dialogue is slick, with every scene super charged with tension and menace! A truly great movie!",1,0.7097103595733643,joy

"The throwaway line that defines his character is somewhere else in this scene: &quot;They all pay sooner or later&quot; -- referring to the clients he must court and pander to. As a mere salesman who lives on commission he identifies with people treated as second-class citizens, like women, and that resentment fuels his desire. Later, he even declines his boss&#39;s offer of an executive job; he&#39;s attached to his lowered status.<br>&#39;",2,0.6901187896728516,love
