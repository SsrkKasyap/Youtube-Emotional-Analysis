"Here is an idea that could have happened after Doc Hopper and his henchmen ran away after seeing Animal:<br><br>(Doc Hopper, gunmen, frog killer, and Max running away)<br>Police: Hold it right, you are all under arrest for attempting to murder an innocent frog.  <br>Kermit: Just a minute officer, the only ones who should be arrested are Doc Hopper, these gunmen, and the frog killer.  This man named Max is innocent.  <br>Police: Thank you Mr. The Frog.  Max, you are free to go.  The rest of you get into that police car, you are all under arrest.  <br>Max: Thank you Kermit.  I&#39;m not working for Doc Hopper anymore.  Could I join all of you going to Hollywood?  It&#39;s fine with me.  What about the rest of you?  Is it okay?  <br>All the Muppets: Yes.  <br>Kermit: Lets all go to Hollywood together.  <br><br>(It&#39;s too bad something like this didn&#39;t happen and I would have loved if Max joined the muppets in going to Hollywood but of course, the only thing he couldn&#39;t star in was at the end when all the muppets sang together after their set was destroyed).",2,0.8236260414123535,love

"This scene honestly adds a lot of depth to Doc Hooper as a character. When he removes his hat and stands there in silence, I interpret it as him knowing fully well that what Kermit is saying is true, and most-likely reconsiders his decision to exploit or kill Kermit for his own gain. But despite the various opportunities of redemption, he chooses to remain his greedy, evil self, as he feels comfortable with living like that. He&#39;s probably a good person deep down as Kermit says, but his bad decisions pretty much outweigh his true self. Reminds me a lot of Jimmy McGill and his alter ego Saul Goodman in a way",2,0.5923497080802917,love
