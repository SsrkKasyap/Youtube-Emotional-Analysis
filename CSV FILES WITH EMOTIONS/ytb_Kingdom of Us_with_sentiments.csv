The mother was just amazing.,2,0.9098080992698669,love
Think all the kids act immature falling out like toddlers over mindless stuff and it&#39;s clear they are out of touch with reality.  Dad was mentally unwell. Feel sorry for the mum. Cringed at the kids all the way through to be honest.,2,0.7621977925300598,love

"need to raise awareness that everyone is going to experience this sometime in there life.  where it is lost of health, ability or loved ones. society need to change we are more connected to technology now then ever but disconnected from life. humans aren&#39;t designed to take on all the stress of modern life and rates of suicide amongst family men is a hidden pandemic.  families do need dads  i grew up missed that  its caused great grief no body teach or be by your side leads to generational depression",2,0.5654460787773132,love

"I believe it was something more than just clinically depressed here (having severe depression myself), but to mock a serious illness by saying &quot;he had kids, he&#39;s a selfish pig&quot;, or whatever, is cruel. Something was seriously wrong, as w cancer, MS etc...we don&#39;t condemn them.",2,0.5750610828399658,love
"Yesterday I was thinking &#39;&#39;I need encouragement to keep going.&#39;&#39; This documentary really broke my heart. I cried under the whole documentary. I have suicidal thoughts, and this doc. really did that I was thinking of my own family. I realized that I can&#39;t let the demons win. I can&#39;t give up everything, even if I hate my life. I had my suicide planned out before this documentary. I still have suicidal thoughts, but I&#39;m not going to die yet. Thank you for that. / 18/04/06",2,0.6238608956336975,love

"This documentary was great, but I kept feeling that if the poor father had at least one more son, he might have felt the need to hang on. I can&#39;t imagine being a man and being subjected to such Estrogen poisoning. The family was bright and good looking, of that there is no doubt, but the stress of raising so many daughters must have been very affecting mentally.",2,0.7708420753479004,love

It was his choice..at least he didn&#39;t kill his family.<br>Excellent documentary.,1,0.6863033175468445,joy
"Considering his original plan was to kill the entire family, I&#39;d say he did everyone a favor.  Mom is in desperate need of help and support, I admire her greatly for getting through each day and keeping the kids together, but the yard and house are in desperate need of cleaning up and organization.  Good film and I hope each one of them gets the help they need to be able to push forward in life and to help mom out with the house, at some point.",2,0.8043267130851746,love

I would love to be able to listen to the music of Paul Shanks. Is there a sound track to this film?,2,0.8043079972267151,love
"Loved the documentary, but hate this trailer! &quot;Grief becomes strength&quot;? That&#39;s clearly not what the filmmaker is saying at all! The tooth-aching sugar-coating in the trailer really demeans a poignant and beautifully made film. It&#39;s dark, dramatic and fascinating - doesn&#39;t need to be made palatable.",1,0.5837298631668091,joy
Calling someone who is clinically depressed and commits suicide &quot;selfish&quot; is tantamount to calling someone who is gay &quot;perverted&quot;.<br>Only some people here will get why this is wrong. The others (mainly the religious folk) will be like &quot;duh!&quot;,0,0.877902626991272,sadness

"Looks like an interesting story, but there&#39;s a worrying lack of diversity in the casting. Not good enough, Netflix.",1,0.8271543979644775,joy
"This should hopefully makeup for the mockery and excuse for suicide awareness that was &#39;13 Reasons Why&#39;, which was basically a YA-rendition of a very serious and currently taboo subject.<br><br>This looks like the type of content people should be viewing, if they really want to understand and &#39;feel&#39; the importance of mental health, and the absolute sense of hopelessness you can feel, despite having the best things in the world. Which, obviously in this man&#39;s case, was his daughters.<br><br>This documentary looks incredibly profound.",1,0.5731236338615417,joy

it is selfish but you don&#39;t know how much deep depression can eat you until you fall in it yourself..... and to seek out for others and be ignored just piles on top of it. especially those closest to you it&#39;s gotta sting.,0,0.758497416973114,sadness

"Know your limitations. I have one kid and I&#39;m stopping at one. I want to maximize my love and resources on to one hopefully productive member of society. There is way less at stake this way. My Fathers family had nine children and raised them in poverty. They aren&#39;t well adjusted. My mothers family had 14 rich little assholes, also not very well adjusted. I myself am the youngest of three. We were poor but we turned out ok. I know my limitations emotionally and fiscally, one kid is enough.",2,0.6802643537521362,love
