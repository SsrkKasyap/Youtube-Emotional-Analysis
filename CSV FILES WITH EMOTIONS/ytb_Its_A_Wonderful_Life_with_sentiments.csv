I love this movie so much but I like to think of it as a comedy sometimes and it’s hilarious.  “I’ll hang her up” is such a great line,2,0.6775303483009338,love

"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=5m46s"">5:46</a> and I love how the wife is acting like a wife. She helps him and loves George even if he is not loving himself she knows he is in a bad mood. But how she just looks at him like she doesn’t want to see him so upset shows her acting from the heart also. She knows what he’s doing and knows something is obviously wrong and is trying to stop him from being stupid and get him to talk.",2,0.7293841242790222,love

"WOAH. That scene in his daughters bed was REAL. You know kids have to like being around you to actually want to be and you can see who either hates or loves the kids. In that scene he shows his cars and softness with her and it seems so real with the zen the kid is in by not thinking of anything much but just being her kid self dreaming and just infatuated with the flower @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a> she is staring at it! Look at the eyes just admiring the flower you’ll see what I mean. George is so worried about his daughter and the energy in this whole incident is heart warming because it was real! It was from the heart!",2,0.7191898822784424,love
Wowww! This scene you learn so many lessons. He cares but is bottled up with experiences yet to be talked about and things on his mind yet to share his feelings to. at least that’s what he thinks because everyone still loves him but he is so down on himself and in such a negative state of mind he doesn’t see the good anymore,2,0.9315723776817322,love

"Can I just point out how good of a wife, friend, and mother Mary is to her husband and children? As soon as her husband came home she greeted him warmly, chatted brightly to him about her day and the kid’s days and the holidays, and showed concern for him when it was quite obvious he was deeply upset about something. This is how every partner should treat their significant other.",2,0.9014561176300049,love

George Bailey is a punk. He verbally abused his wife and children He physically assaulted his brother BIlly and threatened his child&#39;s teacher.
