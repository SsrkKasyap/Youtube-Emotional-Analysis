I wish they kept him fat. It shows how depression can affect even Thor. Keeping him fat in future movies would show that his depression wasn‚Äôt just cured because they undid the Snap and rediscovered his worth. Especially when the theme they were going for in Love and Thunder was love. How he felt lonely. A major contributor to depression.,2,0.5788657665252686,love

"This shows how much a person can slip into depression because of countless encounter with lost of love ones and failures. Thor literally lost his everything.  In Thor 2, he lost his mother when he could actually save her on time. In infinity war, He literally watch his brother get strangle to death by thanos. In Ragnarok, he also watch his father dies Infront of him and he couldn&#39;t even save his home because he was forced to destroy it to destroy his sister. He lost all his friend(except sif) too when Hela return and wipe out the Asgardian armies. And as for Hela, yep though she was evil and we can&#39;t seems to see why would Thor even lost her but still she was their sister and part of the Odin family and Thor was force to kill her to save the rest of the Asgardian. And again in infinity war, he was the last surviving avengers that could potentially bring down thanos but like what Thanos said, he forgotten to gone for the head and see thanos snap the finger Infront of him and wipe out half of the world population. In a way he feels that it is his fault. So when I saw him in this state. I would say both happy and sad for him as he is now free of such troubled mind but at the sametime it is so sad to see the once mighty Thor that have so much passion to save the world and to fight for justice have lost that passion and now hiding within 4 walls of a cottage and live on for the rest of the life munching on snacks and beers and playing games.",2,0.8218128681182861,love
