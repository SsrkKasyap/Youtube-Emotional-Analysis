In this world there are very few things that are a better source of inspiration than rejection. It can crush an ego almost as well as lifting a spirit to greatness.,2,0.4866494834423065,love

"People say re-watch your favourite movie or re-read your fav novel at different phases of your life.<br>At each phase different parts will give you different meanings depending upon what situation you&#39;re in.<br>And man, so true can someone be?<br>Earlier I used to go over the rose tinted parts of the movie for that seemed relatable, and wouldn&#39;t understand the later parts.<br>And now when im in a similar place, when getting up merely from bed seems so uphill a task, when the thought of living on my own after she walked away sends a me a shudder and fills me with uncertainty,  this scene looks so beautiful now. Perhaps the best part of the movie.",1,0.4819933772087097,joy
"I‚Äôm going  through an extremely painful divorce after my husband abandoned me and took half of my money with him. When I get overwhelmed, I listen to this song, get up, take my dog for a walk and remind myself that life doesn‚Äôt end here. You just have to put forth the effort yourself and not rely on one person to make you happy.",2,0.8881772756576538,love
I find it interesting that you never actually see the guy that Summer marries.,2,0.8787174820899963,love
"i rewatch this scene and listen to this song every time i start to relapse and feel nostalgic for someone from the past who didn‚Äôt wanna commit to me. it makes me feel hopeful, strong and motivated.

"This scene was my favorite, I really related to this character and this really motivated me, as an aspiring architect student and a rather hopeless romantic, also I love JGL!!!!!&lt;3",2,0.8437832593917847,love
Classic‚Ä¶lets just lie to these men and let them think that self improvement will get them female attraction (it doesn‚Äôt). You are either born perfect and handsome or you aren‚Äôt and women will never like you. Movies like this is just delusional and wants to manipulate men into being productive for no reason and no purpose.,2,0.8002176284790039,love
This is the best scene in the film in my opinion. After being so emotionally bound to summer and being devastated by her being engaged he reached an absolute low point. He then makes a choice to reinvent himself and pursue his passion which is architecture. Many men can relate to this time in their lives when they ‚Äúget their shit together‚Äù and really being to understand the higher levels of life. It all starts from within.,2,0.6011666655540466,love

This scene stuck in my head and led me to get into urban sketching in 2021.,2,0.4944115877151489,love
Sometimes you just gotta say fuck it and move on by force and try new things. Hopefully anyone who is watching this is finding their purpose and moving forward,2,0.6563279032707214,love
"In terms of a movie about a &quot;significant other&quot; who isn&#39;t the one, there is no movie that comes close to this in the way of showing someone realistically build themselves back up again to be confident enough to find the right person for them.  This scene is absolutely wonderful and I would argue is what takes this movie to that perfect level of cinema.<br><br>10 out of 10.",1,0.8015061020851135,joy
