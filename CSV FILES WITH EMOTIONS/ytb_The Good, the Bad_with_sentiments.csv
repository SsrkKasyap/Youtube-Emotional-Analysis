Love Clint but my favorite actor in this is Eli Wallach. He played Tuco w heart and humor. His story made you feel sympathy for him especially his scenes w his brother. A classic movie that I always get drawn into whenever it pops up on tv.,2,0.8290045261383057,love

"I love how Blondie is just toying with both Tuco and Angel Eyes.  He could have easily shot both Tuco and Angel Eyes when they were both getting into their positions.  And he knew that Tuco&#39;s gun was empty so he only had Angel Eyes as his lone target.  But he let it all play out and Tuco shot at Angel Eyes so he knew he could still trust Tuco.  Blondie was holding all the cards and the other two didn&#39;t even know it.  Like from Sun Tsu&#39;s Art of War, a battle is won before it&#39;s even fought.",2,0.9427144527435303,love
