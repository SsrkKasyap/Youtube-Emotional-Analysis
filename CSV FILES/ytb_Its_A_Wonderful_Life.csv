1,I love this movie so much but I like to think of it as a comedy sometimes and it’s hilarious.  “I’ll hang her up” is such a great line,Ed Scmidt

9,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=7m13s"">7:13</a> woah! Look how everyone looks at this man. You can feel the sadness in the faces and the scene! The energy they are giving off! That was a real sad scene",KidTakeFlight
10,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=5m46s"">5:46</a> and I love how the wife is acting like a wife. She helps him and loves George even if he is not loving himself she knows he is in a bad mood. But how she just looks at him like she doesn’t want to see him so upset shows her acting from the heart also. She knows what he’s doing and knows something is obviously wrong and is trying to stop him from being stupid and get him to talk.",KidTakeFlight
11,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=5m46s"">5:46</a> George taking his anger out literally! On a woman he doesn’t even know! Just thinking of something he’s mad about and just putting it all out there on here making her the problem or the dumpster or negativity",KidTakeFlight
12,"WOAH. That scene in his daughters bed was REAL. You know kids have to like being around you to actually want to be and you can see who either hates or loves the kids. In that scene he shows his cars and softness with her and it seems so real with the zen the kid is in by not thinking of anything much but just being her kid self dreaming and just infatuated with the flower @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgUpU_AFKA&amp;t=5m10s"">5:10</a> she is staring at it! Look at the eyes just admiring the flower you’ll see what I mean. George is so worried about his daughter and the energy in this whole incident is heart warming because it was real! It was from the heart!",KidTakeFlight
13,Wowww! This scene you learn so many lessons. He cares but is bottled up with experiences yet to be talked about and things on his mind yet to share his feelings to. at least that’s what he thinks because everyone still loves him but he is so down on himself and in such a negative state of mind he doesn’t see the good anymore,KidTakeFlight

15,Here&#39;s a question I don&#39;t know if anyone asked. Why were Zuzu and the other kids in School on Christmas Eve? Was that common back then?,MNsportsnut
16,"&quot;Oh MISTER Welch. Okay that&#39;s fine, Mr. Welch. Give me a chance to tell you what I REALLY think of your wife!&quot; <br>😂😂😂😂",The Dark Knight
17,I love how tender and sweet he is with Zuzu in spite of his shaky mental state. It shows what a great father he is.,12CLASSICS
18,"Can I just point out how good of a wife, friend, and mother Mary is to her husband and children? As soon as her husband came home she greeted him warmly, chatted brightly to him about her day and the kid’s days and the holidays, and showed concern for him when it was quite obvious he was deeply upset about something. This is how every partner should treat their significant other.",コーディ

ESP bc of WHY: To save others...as per always. Bc he was willing 2 die 4 the life ins $ he felt his family would need so badly just 2 survive the poverty he thot would DEF DESTROY HIS FAMILY in near future. And Clarence knew his sweet/insecure/childlike  little wingless heart would have 2b as confident/effective/powerful as they could POSSIBLY become...if he&#39;s the kind of &quot;well-deserving 2b OFFICIAL/WINGED earth angel&quot; he&#39;d HAVE 2b 2 save a man as special/unique( but equally stubborn/hard 2 work with when he&#39;s passionate in his feelings/emotions) young man like poor, poor George Bailey. So poor, FRANTIC/self-doubting Clarence knows HE, HIS ANGEL-SKILLS, &amp; even his precious long-awaited wings , had 2 become MORE CONFIDENT/CAPABLE/POWERFUL than they&#39;d/he&#39;d ever had 2b ...2 save this challenge of a wonderful but very strong-minded &amp; very hopeless man George from making a TERRIBLE MISTAKE: ending his most precious gift--his wonderful life.😇👼🙏🏻🥰👍🙋‍♀️👋",Angel4animals

29,"When I was a kid watching this I thought &quot;man George needs to cool it!&quot;  But as a father now, I realize the stress of fatherhood of providing for the people you love and sacrificing what you love and want to do takes a toll on you.",Nathan Smith

31,"I really felt his pain. Losing your money, facing jail time and dealing with 4 nagging kids, I would have a mental breakdown too. But, it&#39;s better to just go outside or go upstairs to your room and throw a fit there. Don&#39;t trip out in front of the kids.",Marcus Anderson

36,As the oldest of five and my mother going through it. There are a few times I recall my dad getting to this point.<br>Now I understand why my Dad loves It&#39;s A Wonderful Life ❤️,Ashlyn Murray
37,Anyone who is not where they&#39;d hoped to be over the age of 30 can relate to George&#39;s anger.  He wanted to see the world and instead he has a family and is wanted by the authorities.,Tim Daugherty
38,George Bailey is a punk. He verbally abused his wife and children He physically assaulted his brother BIlly and threatened his child&#39;s teacher. In addition to being a drunk and unstable he was a terrible businessman. In today&#39;s world of finance he would have been charged with fraud and mismanagement. How is this guy a hero to anyone?,Roy Santoro
39,Every role he took on he made completely relatable,davidpar2
40,I remember my mom and dad crying at 530 in the morning cause they couldn’t afford the house anymore but they woke us up it was 1993. But my grandma helped us out with my grandpa who was a ww2 vet I miss him greatly he lived right next to us he taught me a lot.,Person Of Pinterest
41,The scene where he grabs his son and cries terrors me apart.,Person Of Pinterest
42,"I completely understand how George is feeling in this scene. But just because you&#39;re frustrated, doesn&#39;t mean you have to treat everyone else frustrated too. <br><br>George <b>SHOULD HAVE</b> told Mary and his kids that Uncle Billy wasn&#39;t being very careful with the money and that he was really VERY frustrated at him for losing it, instead of taking his frustration out on <i>them.</i> 😢",Ring Diamond
43,"It’s horrible to see even a good man like George take his anger out on his family. Also, seeing a phenomenal human being like Jimmy Stewart upset and in tears like that is heartbreaking. Everyone’s reactions here are gut wrenching.",ALLY S
