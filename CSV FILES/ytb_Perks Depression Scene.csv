4,"Reading the book, the way Charlie behaves, communicates.<br>His fixation on asking about hockey and sports.<br>His blunt way of speaking<br>His fixations of reading and literature, diary keeping.<br>Pebbling by making and gifting people with personalised mixtapes.<br>His breakdowns, (in the book) uncontrollable crying or meltdowns.<br>Charlie is painfully relatable and to me autism coded/autistic.<br>Which would make his aunts SA even worse because she took advantage of a vulnerable person in two ways. A minor and a special needs child",Ginger Psycho

6,"Ok, hear me out, I have a reason of depression, I don‚Äôt want to sound bad or anything, but I feel like I‚Äôve lost and been through more than most can handle, at just the age of 8 months I was malnourished and neglected, at the age of 2-13 I was abused physically, mentally, and sexually (only once though) by both parents and their friends, at the age of 4 I was beat to the verge of breaking down totally, at the age of 6 I was raped, at 7 I lost my father to suicide one day after my birthday, when I was 8 my mother was addicted to drugs, at that point on I was abused and neglected, malnourished, starved, and was also abused by her girlfriend, I am quite unintelligent, this sounds stupid but also very unlucky and Unattractive, I was broken and still suffer from trauma to this day, I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think I long for this world, or contribute much, I will always be alone, I don‚Äôt understand why this happened, but there is nothing I can do about it",Red Knight
7,"I kind of feel a similar way to how he feels. I just remembered a lot of repressed memories that I have from school and my last job. I wasn&#39;t actually sexually assaulted but I remember certain things like at my last job, the owners oldest son (older then my coworkers and I) basically spying and watching us on the cameras. It wasn&#39;t just to make sure that we were doing our jobs though. There were other things too like abuse in general. I&#39;ve had people threaten to kill me/beat me up, I&#39;ve been beat up before, people act creepy in certain ways towards me, etc. My family was more abusive in other ways like emotionally and verbally abusive. Watching this movie kind of helps me to deal with it all.<br><br>Edit: My mom has hit me before too. I was actually physically assaulted both at school and at work mostly though.",Trinity Livingston
8,"I remember how he wrapped his arms around me to tell me it would all be okay, and that the pain will go away soon. But it never did. Ever since that day that he first did it, it feels like my insides are bleeding. I feel dirty no matter how many times i scrub at my skin in the shower. I can always feel his breathe against my right ear, I can‚Äôt bear to look at myself in the mirror anymore without seeing some vulnerable boy that could‚Äôve stopped it. Everyone tells me that it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I sure don‚Äôt believe that. I feel broken, forever broken. I can‚Äôt even handle people embracing me anymore. So what‚Äôs the point in living in this reality where he gets to live life to his fullest when I‚Äôm stuck here forever feeling like the little kid i once was, i remember telling my friend about what happened to me and all he did was laugh and say that you would never do that to me. You didn‚Äôt seem like the type of person to do those things, but you did. Nowadays I still flinch and despise taking pictures because of what you‚Äôve done to me. Each time the camera would flicker you‚Äôd strip more of my innocence away, and no matter how many times you apologize I won‚Äôt forget those 4 years that you ruined me. <br><br><br><br>                                         To my Older Cousin",finney
9,"This entire scene really resonates with me on a very deep level. The summer of last year was pretty shit. Honestly every time was really shit, but that summer had some definite highlights. I thankfully never suffered sexual abuse, but I have my fair share of emotional and familial trauma, as well as a slew of other problems that fucked with me for years. That shit just gets to you and overtakes your whole life. When Charlie was alone at home, walking through the house frantically, holding back his tears, and then finally looked at the knife, it‚Äôs exactly what it was like for me when I was close to harming myself with my own kitchen knife. I was just so stuck in my head for so long, and at that point I was overwhelmed with the cluster fuck of regrets, traumas, self hating, and my whole life just playing out with me wishing things were different. When you‚Äôre in that place it just seems like nothing ever went right, and that everything is your fault, and that everyone and everything would be better off without you. But in reality you‚Äôre probably just using that as an excuse to justify the selfish want of wanting to kill yourself because u hate everything about you. You do it for you. I ended up being sent to the ER after having admitted to how I constantly told myself to just kill myself already and the number of times I came close to acting upon it. The doctor that came into the room had such a similar voice to the one in this clip, and it was a very weird feeling having my dad find out about everything. I‚Äôm doing my damn best rn to be in a better place, but goddamn it‚Äôs hard.",Angelo Pellicci

13,The acting&#39;s great but the editing sells it just as much,michael champlin
14,"I related to this scene so much. I was sexually abused by my aunt and I thought it was normal until I was 16. I was ashamed to admit what she did to me. I was embarrassed to admit a woman abused me, especially since I‚Äôm male. It was even worse when my family (my mom‚Äôs side, my dad believed me) said I was lying and an attention seeker.",MAXxT0rr3s
15,Fuck man,Buddha B0mb
16,I feel so dumb I didn&#39;t get this right away and didn&#39;t understood why he was blaming himself for her death. I really thought he looked up to his aunt and only got the hint when he was writing those letters. I&#39;m so naive.,June Lee
17,It truly is a horrible thing to be depressed to the point of suicide. You literally try to think of all the ways to kill yourself and what would be the least painful for you and others. Sadly most attempts fail which leaves people in an even worse state. Depression doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúsad‚Äù it is much more than that.,Nick Amenta

64,"When I saw this movie for the first time (I only watched it once), I was so confused watching the flashbacks. This scene though... You know that feeling when you&#39;re so upset that you could throw up? That&#39;s what I felt watching this scene. People like Charlie&#39;s aunt disgust me, no one, let alone a <b>child</b> should experience this! What is wrong with people?!",Ashley Panzica
65,This movie is the reason why I was able to deal with the fact that my cousin molested me when I was younger. No one know how much it destroys relationships and your brain. How it makes you react to things that no one else would react to. How it feels like everything is going wrong and you‚Äôre a burden.,Waffleita
66,"In my opinion this sick, perverted aunt got off way too easy by committing suicide. She abused and violated Charlie&#39;s trust and took advantage of him... probably because she failed in relationships with adult men or she was just too pathetic to find an adult man to be in a relationship with. Whatever the reason suicide was an easy way out for her.",Ian Hampton

74,I hate that the number one comment on this is that we&#39;re broken. We&#39;re not broken. People did horrible stuff to us and we may have broken but we were kids and we didn&#39;t have much else we could do. We get better. We get older and stronger and we work on ourselves and we rebuild. WE&#39;RE SO FUCKING AMAZING AND ABLE TO GROW AND CHANGE AND ONE DAY WE SEE IT ISN&#39;T OUR FAULT AND IT NEVER WAS AND WE GET TO BE WELL. You can be well. You can wake up almost every day happy and proud of who you are. On the days you aren&#39;t you can be there for yourself and not punish yourself. It&#39;ll take work but it&#39;s there. Its as real as anything else in this fucked up world. DON&#39;T LET PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT IT&#39;S LIKE TELL YOU YOU CAN&#39;T REBUILD YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU CAN. People like feeling like they&#39;re smart and know all the answers and &quot;Oh look at those poor kids with their broke psyches&quot; FUCK THAT!,Frances Meyer
75,"I feel ya üòî. I am actually dealing what charlie&#39;s dealing with since high school &#39;til now. Its kinda really hard for me because no one knows what i really feel. I never open up myself to anyone. I overthink all the things of what will happen if i tell them. Thats why now i still dont know what really is the answer to what i feel. I did not consult anyone even an expert about this coz i really have a hard time talking to someone. Most(or few) of us, deals with this kind of feelings, are not participating because we are not a good speaker nor having confidence to stand facing other people. Sorry if i dont elaborate very much coz its hard for me till now.",Ota Ku
76,"this was one of the best representations of a suicidal breakdown I&#39;ve ever seen. but then, the illusion was totally ruined by the fact charlie was alone in the hospital room with flowers AND two lamps. way too dangerous. the only lights in most psych ward rooms are leds in walls. and flowers? not unless you&#39;re a low-risk longterm patient. and it was so realistic until then too! argh idk why im so pissed over these tiny details.",dumb muso rowan

79,This hit me hard when I watched this scene..I never had a breakdown but I also lived through a similar event. <br>It&#39;s weird and I don&#39;t know how I deal with it but I sometimes do realize certain things I do happen at unconscious level...like.. my aversion to priests and lack of trust issues with strangers to a weird level or things that arise with any shred of intimacy.<br>I realized something the other day.<br>I feel like I&#39;m being used. I feel like I&#39;m just a body and I feel like anyone that tries to get close to me in any intimate/romantic sense has wants something from me. Deep down I know there are issues but I guess I grew comfortable with shoving it deep in my subconscious where I can&#39;t actually see anymore. I guess this scene helped me realize something that has always been there. <br>It&#39;s ok to not be ok.,TheOMGRamen

81,"This is hard to watch because I can relate to Charlie a lot, and it brings back memories of guilt and substance abuse I did to deal with pain, some people  chose to self - harm with razors, I chose to do it with drugs and alcohol. I‚Äôve been through so much abuse that I can‚Äôt even look people in the eye. I don‚Äôt go outside because I hate my appearance. I avoid mirrors, photographs and any kind of intimacy. I tell myself I can live alone but truth is I crave affection and I am shamefully addicted to porn because those 4 seconds of no obsessive suicidal thoughts and ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù  are the only thing in my life that ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me in some way. I have had anxiety and OCD as long as I can remember and was terrible at school, everyone thought I had a cognitive delay and discussed it behind my back.",BLUE
