7,Imagine if Noobmaster69 got the hang of this conversation.,vuvuvu
8,"That part where he says why would I be scared of that guy, I’m the one that killed that guy, anybody else kill that guy? Nope; Always gets me. Such a great way of showing how he internally copes with what happened, and how he doesn’t even believe himself even though he’s probably told himself that a million times.",Some Person

11,When Thor turns into the dood from the big labowski,totally not Bruce Wayne

13,"As much as it isn&#39;t the point of the scene, poor Rocket. For having to smell all that with his keen nose.",Aristocles
14,"It’s crazy that in a scene with a big green guy, a talking rock, a snarky raccoon, and a bug eating pizza on a couch….. the weirdest is somehow Thor with a beer-belly.",Ghoul

17,"Think of the run of bad days Thor had. He lost his father, his sister nearly killed him, he lost his home, he lost his brother, he lost half of the people it was his responsibility to protect and he failed to stop Thanos. He watched helplessly as half of existence disappeared.",aresef
18,"Everyone talking only about Thor being the perfect representation of depression which he’s is great but I wanna talk more about how Bruce handled the situation, he just let Thor know he was there for him with his body language, even when Thor started to lose his calmness Bruce just calmly asked him to stop it was so powerful, I wish I had someone like Bruce when I was struggling most.",Alex Patterson
19,This whole thing was entirely too relatable. Great scene.,Sarkarin
20,"People don’t give Chris Hemsworth enough credit. Here he his in a fat suit, the only person in the room, acting around a bunch of cgi characters, and giving one of his best performances ever.",Matthew LaSalvia
21,Its sad that noone checked on thor until they needed him,lo-zack

24,It&#39;s pretty cool to see how someone like bruce who battled his own inner demon and won is able to look at someone else fighting and have the patience to communicate and help them.,The Truth
25,“Are you here about the cable” lmao,KINGCAM
26,I like the way he says nude master like he&#39;s a real villain,Ryan Garcia
27,I wish they kept him fat. It shows how depression can affect even Thor. Keeping him fat in future movies would show that his depression wasn’t just cured because they undid the Snap and rediscovered his worth. Especially when the theme they were going for in Love and Thunder was love. How he felt lonely. A major contributor to depression.,Cobalt Prime
28,Ahhh uhh was it Natasha ! 😂,They Hold No Quarter
29,What I think is very important is that hulk is there for thor and reminds him that he was the one who helped him back in ragnorok. Being there for people who have been there for you is great,Overlord

32,"I know everyone&#39;s talking about it, but seriously fat Thor makes all the sense. He lost his parents, his brother, his sister, his planet, and half his people. And when he finally got the chance to avenge them, he relished in the moment instead of killing Thanos immediately",Zarc Ono

55,Kenneth Branagh is the only MCU director who made an accurate Thor and didn&#39;t turn him into a stupid joke.,Anton A.
56,"at first, I was like why the hell did they messed up all of Thor&#39;s muscles and charisma. Then did a little research about real Norse myths and learned real Thor was like this too. Fat, drunk and powerful. Now, I actually want to see fat Thor more.",Maxenite
57,Were all here.. THOR,James Peace
58,I love that Thor and Hawkeye were the most depressed out of all the avengers because they literally lost everyone from Thanos. There was no hope for either of them after that,Nateebanks03
59,This scene is so fricken great. Goes from some great laughs to an actually heart touching moment. Thor really did blame himself after all his loved ones from Asgard died,Nateebanks03
60,wtf is that &quot;hulk&quot; ???!!!????!!!!!????!!!!!?????!!!!????! Oo ....he looks n talk like tom cruise.....bs....this is not any hulk,akunakii
61,"What added to the weight that thor&#39;s been carrying for 5 years after hearing banner is when banner said to &quot;fix&quot; things about thanos, thor blamed himself even more because he thinks he&#39;s the only one who messed up real bad and his team are doing their best to &quot;fix&quot; it.",The Pope

63,Re-watching this thing first I thought the fat Thor was funny but now I just feel bad for him because it’s a symbol of the deep depression Thor is supposed to be a hero he’s supposed to protect his people but he failed at that how is he supposed to cope with the fact that he failed the one thing that he was supposed to do above all else,Sir Arthur of Winterfell
64,This scene is so depressing I feel like the comedy was a mandatory &quot;thor hes back that kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again&quot;,film theory

67,"I just love how even though Thor is depressed, he still threatens an online bully &amp; sticks up for his friends. Even when he&#39;s feeling down, don&#39;t get him angry.",Thomas Muller

70,Miek on the sofa eating the pizza was adorable,Arkyshi
71,"Marvel needs to bring emotional scenes like this back. I like the comedic moments in the recent movies, but they tend to ruin a serious moment with a stupid joke every now and then.. I hope GOTG 3 will balance out the humor and emotional scenes evenly. I mean, it&#39;s James Gunn, he definitely won&#39;t mess this up!",IcyianCanehdian

73,"To fair, it was Rocket that snapped him out of his depression and to help his friends again. Rocket says there’s beers in the ship, he’s on board. When Thor had a mental breakdown when he went to the past to see his mother, rocket slapped him the senses back to him.",Alltimefox

75,This is the moment the movie becomes an horror: people still playing Fortnite in 2023. And sadly is gonna happen,Giuseppe
76,"Can we take a moment to appreciate Bruce in this scene? He clearly has been through a transformation of his own since Infinity War. He&#39;s not only so much more confident in helping others with their emotions, he&#39;s much more knowledgable on how to do it right.",KoOkiEzRoCkz
77,seeing that tear from rocket always breaks me,Judas Link
78,"“There’s beer in the Ship” <br><br>Says Rocket, acting like Thor doesn’t have more ‘Supply’ out back. Thor had already made up his mind, He was going to the Avengers Compound one way or another. But now he had a reason to act immediately.",TheRealMr.Incredible

90,Kind of a small reminder here that Thor and Hulks relationship was similar to Ironmans and captain americas,Ace Martiney
91,"&quot;Awh yes that right, Go cry to your father you little weasel..&quot; -Thor<br><br>&quot;Thank you Thor&quot; -Korg<br><br>&quot;You let me know if he bothers you again, Okay?&quot; -Thor<br><br>&quot;Thank you very much, I will&quot; -Korg<br><br>I absolutely love how Korg makes Thor still feel wanted and needed.. Also when Hulk says &quot;Thanos..&quot; Korg instantly stands up to back up his friend.. Even after knowing who the Hulk is and how he was once a Champion that would have killed him if it weren&#39;t for Thor.. That&#39;s a true Friend!",xAoHx
92,"This shows how much a person can slip into depression because of countless encounter with lost of love ones and failures. Thor literally lost his everything.  In Thor 2, he lost his mother when he could actually save her on time. In infinity war, He literally watch his brother get strangle to death by thanos. In Ragnarok, he also watch his father dies Infront of him and he couldn&#39;t even save his home because he was forced to destroy it to destroy his sister. He lost all his friend(except sif) too when Hela return and wipe out the Asgardian armies. And as for Hela, yep though she was evil and we can&#39;t seems to see why would Thor even lost her but still she was their sister and part of the Odin family and Thor was force to kill her to save the rest of the Asgardian. And again in infinity war, he was the last surviving avengers that could potentially bring down thanos but like what Thanos said, he forgotten to gone for the head and see thanos snap the finger Infront of him and wipe out half of the world population. In a way he feels that it is his fault. So when I saw him in this state. I would say both happy and sad for him as he is now free of such troubled mind but at the sametime it is so sad to see the once mighty Thor that have so much passion to save the world and to fight for justice have lost that passion and now hiding within 4 walls of a cottage and live on for the rest of the life munching on snacks and beers and playing games.",Dinozai_gaming
