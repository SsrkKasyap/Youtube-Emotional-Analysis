31,Kins Court..<br>The Kingdom..,"Trippr, Helium"
32,"I wondered the whole movie who gave up on the husband that he needed to be the winner who never gave up on himself. But then again if he truly finds out that he himself would never give up on himself then he will realise he doesn‚Äôt need to be the winner anymore, no matter who gave up on him and gave him this idea.",erikbyt

69,"Richard is continuously a douche throughout the film, between this ignorance towars suicide, shaming olive over ice cream, and prioritising work over family. But I love how he changes toward the end and uses his &quot;winner&quot; mindset for good, persuing the goal of getting olive to the pageant, finally putting his family first and fulfilling his father&#39;s wishes.",MrPenfold4
70,"I was wondering all along : &lt; But, who is that actor ? I saw him in other movies, I&#39;m sure... &gt; and then I found the answer. ;)<br><br><br><br><br>The answer was : No ! No, please, no ! God ! NOOOOOO ! ;)",Pistol'HERO

72,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QNxYSDdpig&amp;t=1m32s"">1:32</a> excellent detail. It‚Äôs both a rude interruption and signifies to the savvy viewer the heaviness of Grandpa‚Äôs intranasal heroin use.",John E. Nobody

82,"I don&#39;t think Greg Kinnear is the bad guy in this movie - and certainly not in this scene.  I know he&#39;s positioned that way throughout the movie, but if you ever watch it again, watch it and tell yourself he&#39;s actually the good guy.",Bret Harley

84,Larry Sugarman is Roger Smith let&#39;s be real..,TribsBon
85,I love this movie.,Thrillseeker8922
86,"I love how this theme of winner vs loser always comes up and Richard is proved wrong. He believes in his 12 steps program, but he barely has any people attending his program and they‚Äôre bankrupt. Frank was the #1 proust scholar in the nation, and his status in his career didn‚Äôt make his life any happier or easier. Dwayne dedicated himself to one day become a pilot, showed extreme discipline by not speaking for hundreds and hundreds of days, then gets told that he actually can‚Äôt because of his color blindness. And last but not least Olive, who wants to win little miss sunshine more than anything doesn‚Äôt win.",Maddie Ashton
