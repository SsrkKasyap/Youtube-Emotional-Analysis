But I know what I would be doing if this came true. I‚Äôd be getting lots of sex. Going in wet, with some of the hottest girls I know, I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they have STD‚Äôs. It would bring me comfort in a time like this",AVERAGE MAN

5,"One of the most pretentious, contrived, random, bullshit films I&#39;ve ever watched.

29,"Reading comments from people complaining that this movie is boring or not scientifically accurate,  people who think that the two planets colliding is the main topic is weird and absurd, but it make sense somehow. <br>Maybe only people who faced mental health issues like severe depression or anxiety for themselves or a close relative can really love this movie. Maybe the luckiest folks who have not experienced it first hand can&#39;t get it and that&#39;s ok.<br>They will shrug and roll the eyes, mumbling &quot;unbelievable&quot; and run away fast when it gets too much, just like John, character in the movie.

53,"Our lives are so limited. We live like we have forever, but where is your hope? Money, career, people, yourself? All will fail us, even our closests friends and family will fail us at times, and will we take nothing with us when we pass. All hope to make it to heaven, but few seek how to get there, because they are distracted by this dying world. Its a narrow path and few find it. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. All need salvation (gay, straight, murderer, &quot;good&quot; person, white, black). Christ died where we should have been so that we may have life since He knew we couldn&#39;t live up to the Law&#39;s standards. May you turn to Him and let Him free you, that when this life passes we will meet in eternity. God bless! Read John, Acts, and Romans.",Lee Ford
54,"Aside from the fact that the science is totally off in this scenario (gravitational and tidal forces would have shattered the earth apart along its center line toward the other planet long before there was an actual collision), I must applaud this scene for expressing so much emotion without one word of conversation.

90,"You know, Lincoln&#39;s latest commercial is awfully reminiscent of this exact thing (/watch?v=D-tIsIpbanQ), and brought this scene to mind. <br><br>Upon watching it again, I realize it&#39;s an ending I&#39;ve never understood the dynamics of. I will have to do another watch of the film in case I missed something, but on its face as a singular movie, I understand that from the cinematic point of view, both visually and symbolically, having Justine face away from the planet in this trilogy formation as the &quot;head&quot; makes sense, especially when coupled with the raw, visceral way that Claire, still reeling from everything with her husband, is absolutely inconsolable, down to the very sinew and molecular structure - she just can&#39;t stay still, can&#39;t hold their hands, can&#39;t, in the face of that oncoming planet, do anything but become a ball of frenetic, energetic turmoil.  I can see how important and impactful that is in its place within the film.  <br><br>But on a merciful level, from the perspective of someone who naturally feels as Justine does in being calmly at peace about the idea of a catastrophic, apocalyptic end, it&#39;d have been kinder for Clare to be in Justine&#39;s place so that she didn&#39;t have to suffer seeing it arrive in real time (though all things considered, maybe that, too, behaves as unintentional commentary on forethought, selfishness, self-awareness, self-absorption, consideration for others, and the presence or lack thereof of mercy; in much the same way it the movie, whether intentional or no, is a great depiction of sickness of wealth, privilege, monochromatism and first world problems - will try viewing the film from those perspectives next time).  Maybe what I suspect is true and the cruelty and/or apathy is the point - I&#39;ve not seen seen the rest of the director&#39;s trilogy to know if that might be the case.<br><br>Still, if anything, I&#39;m surprised Justine didn&#39;t take Claire&#39;s seating position, since she was in tune with the planet enough to want to sunbathe naked in its light and was rather fascinated and in awe of it instead of being fearful. Personally, I&#39;d have sat in Claire&#39;s spot (or opposite Justine, directly facing the oncoming planet - that, to me, would&#39;ve been a true physical depiction of someone at peace with or welcoming its arrival) just to be able to stare at its beauty as it arrives. After all, when it comes to endings, that&#39;s a gorgeous, awe-inspiring, poetic, and thankfully, instantaneous,  way to go.",californication751
