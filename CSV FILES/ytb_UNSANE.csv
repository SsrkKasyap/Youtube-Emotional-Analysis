11,"Almost all commitment is involuntary, but on paper it will be voluntary. They will tell you that if you don’t sign yourself in voluntarily, they can involuntarily commit you and that will wreak much more havoc on your life and record. <br>Most of the time this is a bluff. <br>They see what insurance you hold, and they want that sweet cha-ching, you could continue to push that you don’t want to be committed and they will continue to push back at you. It can get nasty and scary, especially for young people who don’t know what’s going on, or for any relatively sane person who was just going through a rough time. <br>You can push back until they give up and let you leave. <br>But there is always that chance they might somehow, someway, get a court order to involuntarily commit you. This is worst case scenario, (besides a court order to get ECT. Which can also be threatened to patients. The ECT threat should be pushed back on at all costs though.)<br>I don’t think they can actually do it on the spot. It’s an annoying process. They’re counting on you giving in.<br>And usually if you were really THAT much of a danger, you would instead be detained by the police first. <br>If you’re a reasonable human being, the only reason they will try to go hard on a court order is if you piss them off or they have an incessant need to enforce control on those who try to slip through their grasp. <br>The staff are quick to anger and they will lie to other staff to get you into trouble if they don’t like you. Remember, you’re a “crazy person”. <br>If Nurse Jacket says you were acting out, and a hoard of staff come over to your bed while you are sleeping like a baby. Rest assured, they will wake you up, just to shoot Haldol up your ass. And sedate you silly. You will become restless all over your body yet unable to close your eyes and rest.<br>Because Nurse Jacket said you were acting out. And that’s all that matters. Not the fact that you were actually sleeping like a baby, doing absolutely nothing wrong. <br> <br>Be warned. Think twice about taking yourself to a hospital or doctor in times of trouble, think twice about telling your therapist you are suicidal. <br>Unless you actually want to end up on a psych ward or just crave the attention, don’t do it. <br>Personally, I’d rather die than go back there. <br>The mental health care system breeds dishonesty. You will be punished for telling the truth.",Aikaterine Illt
