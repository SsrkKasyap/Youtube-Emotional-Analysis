4,"quick psa: some places can invoke an injunction that includes spending (in the US that‚Äôs called conservatorship, and it can be temporary or longer term); plus option to mandate treatment by law due to illness that make the person temporarily or more chronically unable to make that choice themselves due to the illness. so this includes illnesses that affect cognitive functioning. sometimes these things can help, other times they don‚Äôt and all services may not be available in all areas. there are also legal maneuvers and strategies that can protect loved ones if necessary. domestic violence shelters, social workers, and crisis lines should have that information and some would be mandated reporterss, along with physicans. they‚Äôre legally obligated to help. seek their advice if you or someone you love is struggling.",DominionMovementDotCom
5,The kids are as bat shit crazy as the father! Hell! They all need help! Only the mother looks as If she&#39;s stable! They are screwed! The UK has free healthcare! They should sign the whole family!,Rhonda Flowers
6,Wow what a wonderful documentary. I just finished watching it. I love this family. May God be the father of this family.,Awungshi M. Zimik

9,At the end... I burst out crying. My god so sad but they are so strong!! What a great family.,Silvertree 21
10,"Maybe having so many kids was a symptom of his illness - he didn&#39;t know when to stop. The reality was chaos and exhaustion that his &#39;happy&#39; facade couldn&#39;t cope with.  It&#39;s hard having a parent who has two sides but kids love them unconditionally - no matter what.  It&#39;s when that parent dies that the guilt surfaces, when we realise just how low and dark that parent must have felt.  Unacknowledged mental health issues in a parent, is terribly confusing for their children and can have a long lasting negative affect on them.  Suicide of a parent is an unbearable legacy - they were lucky to have a strong mother.",Twinkle Twinkle
11,The mother was just amazing.,Ktalks
12,Think all the kids act immature falling out like toddlers over mindless stuff and it&#39;s clear they are out of touch with reality.  Dad was mentally unwell. Feel sorry for the mum. Cringed at the kids all the way through to be honest.,Autumnfall

18,"My dad also killed himself and had   exactly the same mental disease. I was only three when he died so I never understood. My mum and brother didn&#39;t talk about it so much. My mum just kept repeating that dad was in too much pain and did what he thought was best for us... I&#39;m so confused. I can&#39;t regulate emotions and only see people as good and that made my life very difficult. I got abused in a relationship and just couldn&#39;t understand any of it, why? I&#39;ve been a psychiatric patient for a long time now, started when I was 16. Currently in hospital now. Doctors diagnosis is always borderline but also PTSD and panic... I get scared a lot now. I&#39;m so confused about all the emotions, the self destructive behavior, the black and white thinking... it&#39;s exhausting to live like this. I see my dad as my guardian angel and protector, but then why did all the bad things happen when I got older? My ex really emotionally and physically hurt me a lot of times and I just can&#39;t give that a place. I loved my dad so he&#39;s a good person. But I also loved my ex... I&#39;m so so confused. Please someone teach me how normal people would think and feel emotions üòûüò• I wish we talked about dad more at  home. We don&#39;t have notes he made or many videos of him. That makes it really hard cause I can&#39;t understand what he was thinking and why he sometimes did bad things... I only know I love him so much and think of him every time I get bad again... sorry for the long text. The movie just gave so many answers and questions at the same time, I cried a lot watching it. ü§ïüòì I wish our family talked more but that&#39;ll never really happen. I don&#39;t know what to do anymore",Lotte Van Doren
19,"Powerful look inside the devastation caused by suicide, The never knowing why? The maybe ifs?, Its enough to drive you insane, I so admire the Mum here, Can someone please get hold of her &amp; let her let go of all this once &amp; for all?. She is so close to the edge &amp; it&#39;s like everyone is oblivious, Caught up inside their own hurt, Mum you are are wonderful example of a genuine lovely person, It is time for you to put this to bed &amp; close the door, Please go on with your life &amp; don&#39;t be afraid to have time for just you, You have earned some peace in your life, Someone to be there just for you once in a while, Don&#39;t ever forget, You are here now &amp; it is time for you to be just you, I really hope things have improved for you?

20,l&#39;histoire d&#39;une famille touchante mais surtout attachante. je n&#39;ai pas cess√© de verser des larmes devant ce documentaire. on ne peut que leur souhaiter du bonheur et un immense courage.,El≈ºbieta B. Romanek
21,"need to raise awareness that everyone is going to experience this sometime in there life.  where it is lost of health, ability or loved ones. society need to change we are more connected to technology now then ever but disconnected from life. humans aren&#39;t designed to take on all the stress of modern life and rates of suicide amongst family men is a hidden pandemic.  families do need dads  i grew up missed that  its caused great grief no body teach or be by your side leads to generational depression",mickey T
22,J&#39;ai ador√©.  J&#39;ai √©t√©e happ√©e par l&#39;histoire de cette famille adorable.   Merci √† eux.,li mou
23,"I believe it was something more than just clinically depressed here (having severe depression myself), but to mock a serious illness by saying &quot;he had kids, he&#39;s a selfish pig&quot;, or whatever, is cruel. Something was seriously wrong, as w cancer, MS etc...we don&#39;t condemn them.",John Doe
24,"Yesterday I was thinking &#39;&#39;I need encouragement to keep going.&#39;&#39; This documentary really broke my heart. I cried under the whole documentary. I have suicidal thoughts, and this doc. really did that I was thinking of my own family. I realized that I can&#39;t let the demons win. I can&#39;t give up everything, even if I hate my life. I had my suicide planned out before this documentary. I still have suicidal thoughts, but I&#39;m not going to die yet. Thank you for that. / 18/04/06",Isabelle 01

27,"This documentary was great, but I kept feeling that if the poor father had at least one more son, he might have felt the need to hang on. I can&#39;t imagine being a man and being subjected to such Estrogen poisoning. The family was bright and good looking, of that there is no doubt, but the stress of raising so many daughters must have been very affecting mentally.",Mable Syrup

30,"I just finished this film. What a haunting, devastating, beautiful and hopeful film this was, and by the end, I was completely in love with this family. This would be my choice for the best film of 2017!",Patrick Riley
31,"In his mind  he was probably doing his family a &quot;big favour&quot; by killing himself , so he could would longer affect them with his depression &amp; darkmoods everyday . He would gave thought about the plan in great depth &amp; detail for a very long time and in the end the desire to escape was more important  to him than sparing his family a life sentence of grief . He is a very selfish man for not caring about what he&#39;s put his family through  but I&#39;m glad he only took himself out and didn&#39;t do a murder suicide. There are other people in this world battling the monsters in their heads who don&#39;t go and make their loved ones cry ! That should be the driving  force that stops a rational/ irrational human from ending it all. MENTAL ILLNESS IS NO EXCUSE FOR SUICIDE",Veda desma

34,This is beautifully done and very moving. Its 6 men a day. Let&#39;s start to listen,Garry Clarkson
35,"I watched this documentary on Netflix and I have to say it gives me a contradiction of emotions. I find everyone in it annoying yet I am intrigued by their individual differences and how they respectively dealt with their father&#39;s suicide and their father in general. They were all at different stages in the grieving process and they all had thoughts and opinions on their childhood that conflicted because they are all so different. I enjoyed that part however there was so much ambiguity. I think it explains the complex state of affairs that a family can go through but the family seem very unintelligent when it comes to their emotions or even just generic life. They seem to detest their father yet mourn for something they never really had. The mother is the only one who understands the entire thing - she lived with him longer than her children did, they are asking her for answers - she holds all the cards and she seems to be just living in dissary and not doing anything about her situation. She made 7 children with him, and his irresponsibility to leave her with all 7 in those circumstances was disgusting. However, she chose to have 7 children, it&#39;s her responsibility to see that they are looked after and cared for correctly with their disabilities. My advice is - never have children unless you are physically, mentally, emotionally and monetarily able to care for them and only have as much children as you know you can look after.",James MacGregor
36,"This was so sad, my father took his life when I was four.  Very touching . You leave your pain , but  you  give pain to those who you loved and loved you.  Sad.",dee lewis

38,"Osborn&#39;s pseudo-philosophical, masturbatory monologues make it unwatchable, unfortunately.",josh
39,It was his choice..at least he didn&#39;t kill his family.<br>Excellent documentary.,Hector Castaneda
40,"Considering his original plan was to kill the entire family, I&#39;d say he did everyone a favor.  Mom is in desperate need of help and support, I admire her greatly for getting through each day and keeping the kids together, but the yard and house are in desperate need of cleaning up and organization.  Good film and I hope each one of them gets the help they need to be able to push forward in life and to help mom out with the house, at some point.",Tiche71
41,this doc broke my heart,JAY
42,I would love to be able to listen to the music of Paul Shanks. Is there a sound track to this film?,donna pavlosky
43,"Loved the documentary, but hate this trailer! &quot;Grief becomes strength&quot;? That&#39;s clearly not what the filmmaker is saying at all! The tooth-aching sugar-coating in the trailer really demeans a poignant and beautifully made film. It&#39;s dark, dramatic and fascinating - doesn&#39;t need to be made palatable.",Millie Marsh
44,Calling someone who is clinically depressed and commits suicide &quot;selfish&quot; is tantamount to calling someone who is gay &quot;perverted&quot;.<br>Only some people here will get why this is wrong.

46,"Looks like an interesting story, but there&#39;s a worrying lack of diversity in the casting. Not good enough, Netflix.",KingZ
47,"This should hopefully makeup for the mockery and excuse for suicide awareness that was &#39;13 Reasons Why&#39;, which was basically a YA-rendition of a very serious and currently taboo subject.<br><br>This looks like the type of content people should be viewing, if they really want to understand and &#39;feel&#39; the importance of mental health, and the absolute sense of hopelessness you can feel, despite having the best things in the world. Which, obviously in this man&#39;s case, was his daughters.<br><br>This documentary looks incredibly profound.",TetraVaal

My Fathers family had nine children and raised them in poverty. They aren&#39;t well adjusted. My mothers family had 14 rich little assholes, also not very well adjusted. I myself am the youngest of three. We were poor but we turned out ok. I know my limitations emotionally and fiscally, one kid is enough.",RandomTuber782
