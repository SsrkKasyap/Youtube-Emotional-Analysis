13,Love Clint but my favorite actor in this is Eli Wallach. He played Tuco w heart and humor. His story made you feel sympathy for him especially his scenes w his brother. A classic movie that I always get drawn into whenever it pops up on tv.,Mrs Blue Sky

40,One of the greatest westerns ever! Great cinematography and great music⭐⭐⭐⭐,Jacob James
41,"I love how Blondie is just toying with both Tuco and Angel Eyes.  He could have easily shot both Tuco and Angel Eyes when they were both getting into their positions.  And he knew that Tuco&#39;s gun was empty so he only had Angel Eyes as his lone target.  But he let it all play out and Tuco shot at Angel Eyes so he knew he could still trust Tuco.  Blondie was holding all the cards and the other two didn&#39;t even know it.  Like from Sun Tsu&#39;s Art of War, a battle is won before it&#39;s even fought.",Jon W.

And if there was no money in it then it implies that Bill carson must have said about the grave with money to be around grave of Arch stanton... If I were Angel eyes, I would kill Tuco and blondie and start searching graves around that of Arch stanton.",Rishu Shrivastav

Something else, when Tuco is standing on the cross with his head in the noos, sometimes the knot is low to his neck and sometimes it is high enough to see light below it and above his head! Guess they made numerous &#39;takes&#39;. Maybe he lost his footing a couple times? Anyway, just stuff you notice after watching the movie so many times. GREAT MOVIE!",Sparks 51
