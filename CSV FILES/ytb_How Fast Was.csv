18,"The ultimate film noir, with the wonderful Barbara Stanwyck playing the femme fatale, and not forgetting the Fred MacMurray, cast as the smooth insurance salesman who gets drawn into the web of deceit and murder.

28,"The throwaway line that defines his character is somewhere else in this scene: &quot;They all pay sooner or later&quot; -- referring to the clients he must court and pander to. As a mere salesman who lives on commission he identifies with people treated as second-class citizens, like women, and that resentment fuels his desire. Later, he even declines his boss&#39;s offer of an executive job; he&#39;s attached to his lowered status.<br>&#39;",Stephen B

60,"Just watched this gem for the first time and it is excellent!  Gonna be watching it again real soon.  One question:  why is Walter wearing a ring on his left-hand ring finger if he is single?  I know not every ring is a wedding ring, but that&#39;s what it means when you wear it on the 3rd finger of your left hand.  A pinkie ring or class ring, I understand.  But this is weird.

76,"Paper Analysis<br><br>Double Indemnity<br><br><br>Double Indemnity<br><br>Double Indemnity explores a highly celebrated film<br>production, which castes urban crime drama where an avaricious, week man is<br>lured and trapped materialistic things. Walter Huff seduces insurance agent,<br>Nordlinger, into having her husband murdered to procure his accident policy.<br>The murder goes as planned. However, the passion of the couple cools but they<br>become very suspicious of their motives. Both Huff and Nordlinger are deceitful<br>and callous lovers who would not stop at anything to fulfill their selfish<br>motives. The pair have a way of cunningly making their friends and foe perish.<br>They have a weird way of extending their ill motives to whoever they consider a<br>threat to them. Half calculates, cold-blood scheme to ferociously murder Nordlinger‚Äôs<br>husband owing to his lustful desire for financial gain. He has identified a<br>double indemnity clause in Nordlinger husband‚Äôs accident policy. By good luck,<br>their plan fails by a whisker and Nordlinger‚Äôs husband survive his noose. His<br>conspiracy is fraudulent and leads to leads to guilt, betrayal, suspicion, and<br>deceit. The plot to have his client murdered leaves behind a trail of thrilling<br>intrigues in the film with various strips of nasty and sharp dialogue as his<br>actions are revealed.<br>Red Wind¬†¬† <br>First published in 1938, the setting of Red Wind is in Southern California, on a warm<br>evening. The audience comes to learn about this since this is the spot where<br>Santa Ana winds, traditionally occur. The story castes Philip Marlowe as the main<br>character and he plays the role of a detective. Dalmas is having a nice time<br>with friends at a bar. In the midst of their story, they notice a man walking<br>in search of a woman. The man gives a comprehensive description of who he is<br>looking for. Formerly a detective, John Dalmas is the anti-hero in Red Wind. In the<br>line of duty Marlowe reveals that Lola colludes with Waldo for a gems business at<br>a bar. Marlowe tries to assist Lola to recover her gems and at the same time secures<br>his escape from the plot to kill him the same way Waldo was murdered in a bar. Notably,<br>The Red Wind is figurative as it embodies bloodshed and violence. Dalmas character<br>that which embodies double standards. He is strange and highly motivated by the<br>love of a lady who swears to give him protection after he helped her out in her<br>distress. The main theme that runs deep in The Red Wind is the motif of<br>violence and that of death as things seem to happen, especially when the winds<br>no longer blow. <br>Mostly set in the urban areas, the two films reflect the cultural reactions on post modernity. Both Red Wind and Double Indemnity are detective stories who try to explore and unravel murder mysteries. In both<br> the stories, feminism takes center stage to give guide the storyline. While the setting of Red Wind is in a Southern California Bar, Double Indemnity is set at an insurance bureau. The themes in these stories revolve around crime and the detective conventions. Much of the hostilities that characterize the characters in these stories are the results of the cold war, which renders a feeling of mistrust, fear, and guilt amongst the erstwhile friends. The two films depict with precision, the anti-hero consciousness who try to survive but end up losing. <br>~writershub411@gmail.com",Writers Hub

87,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! I love how even though the actors are good (for their era) at emulating &quot;realistic&quot; and nonchalant dialogue, it still comes off as a &quot;performance&quot; (esp. from Fred MacMurray), but I LOVE it, it gives it a bit of a theatrical edge that many great movies today have lost due to being hyper-realistic.",BuzzKirill
88,"a great deal of production effort into <a href=""http://movieclips.com"">movieclips.com</a>.¬† Impressive!<br><br>As far as Double Indemnity; what a classic film noir!¬† Its almost as if all the major players who came after studied Barbara Stanwyck in this role.¬† She set the standard for noir femme fatales didn&#39;t she?¬† Fred was a little mushy for my taste and I&#39;m afraid actually dragged the movie down in a lot of spots; his 1930s gangster style rapid fire delivery of his lines along with his narrative style are what saved him from sinking the whole business.¬† He is definitely more suited to &quot;My Three Sons&quot; where he is safe from designing women..",learningrichard

90,"A fantastic film which has aged very well indeed. Tight and twisty plotting, engagingly sparky dialogue, meticulous and nuanced performances.

96,&quot;I wonder if you wonder&quot;.  A Raymond Chandler(creator of P.Marlowe) moviescript. I believe his only one and Billy Wilder Directing. Razor sharp dialogues and great shots. A delicious story about lust and betrayal. Film Noir At it&#39;s finest with Edward G Robinson. And what about the music and the opening. One of the best movies ever made and somehow it always reminds me of My other Noir favorite Blood Simple.,decunamus2
